# Introduction

A learning experience into Rust, and the bevy game engine. 
This repo hods a prototype for a pixel-dungeoncrawler. It is not ready to be played. 
Currently you can move around, and mindless enemies spawn that do nothing.

# Running

If you want to 'play' (as stated, the game is not ready to be played) the game, clone the repo and run it like any normal Rust program. 

```shell
cargo run --release
```
To read the documentation, type:
```shell
cargo doc --open
```
